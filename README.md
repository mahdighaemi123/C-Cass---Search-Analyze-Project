    ******************************
    This is classroom practice 
    This script will generate datas and test time complexity for 3 search algorithm with unsorted array
        1.Liniear search
        2.Random search
        3.Full random search
    ******************************
    Out put will be like this : 
        Average time complexity for Liniear search     = N
        Average time complexity for Random search      = N 
        Average time complexity for Full random search = N
